		<h2>Structured data</h2>
		<p>Data that can be easily categorized and analysed e.g. numbers and words. It is mainly generated because of network sensors embedded in electronic devices, Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) devices etc. Structured data also include transaction data ,sales figures, account balances etc. This type describes data which is grouped in rows and columns within a standard database i.e. into a relational scheme. The data configuration and consistency allows it to respond to simple queries to arrive at usable information, based on an organization’s parameters and operational needs</p>
	<h2>Semi structured data</h2>
	<p> It is a form of structured data that does not conform to an explicit and fixed schema. The data is inherently self-describing and contains tags or other markers to enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Examples include weblogs and social media feeds. Unstructured data: It comprises of more complex information, such as customer reviews from commercial websites, photos and other multimedia, and comments on social networking sites. These data cannot easily be separated into categories or analysed numerically. </p>
	<h2>Unstructured big</h2>
	<p>data is the things that humans are saying,? says big data consulting from vice president Tony Jewitt of Plano, Texas. ?It uses natural language.This type of data consists of formats which cannot easily be indexed into relational tables for analysis or querying. Examples include images, audio and video files.</p>

		<h1>CHARACTERISTICS OF BID </h1>
	<p>DATA Big data involves vary large data, which is heterogeneous in nature and has a time factor associated with it. With this definition Characteristics of Big data may be summarized in the famous ?The 3V’s? or simply ?V3? model by Gartner , an international research agency</p>
	<h2>3 Vs of Big Data</h2>
		<p>Big data is normally characterized by 3 Vs:</p>
		<li>Volume</li>
		<li>velocity</li>
		<li>variety </li>

	 <h1>Features of Big data</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Big data has many features. It is extremely fragmented due to the variety of data. It does not provide decisions. You need to figure out how to use it to make decisions.</li>
		<li>Big data is not only unstructured data. The structured data component of big data extends and complements your unstructured data. Big data is not a substitute for your structured data. Since most of the information on the internet is available to everyone, it can be used for good causes and at the same time can be misused by antisocial elements to disturb the peace.</li>
		<li>Generally, big data has a wide horizon, so you may have hundreds of fields in each line of your data. It is also very dynamic as gigabytes and terabytes of data are created every day and can change every day like the weather. Big data can be both internal, generated within the organization or external like social media or YouTube.</li>

	<h1>Technology Comparison</h1>
	<p>Here is how traditional technology is different from big data technology</p>
	
	<table border="3" width="600"> 
	<tr> 
	<th>Traditional Technology</th> 
	<th>Big Data Technology </th> 
	
	</tr> 
	
	<tr> 
	<td>	Has a limit on scalability</td> 
	<td>	Highly and massively scalable</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>	Uses highly parallel processors on a single machine</td> 
	<td>	Uses distributed processing with multiple machines</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>	Processors may be distributed, but data is stored at one place</td> 
	<td>	Data is distributed to multiple machines</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td> 	Depends on the expensive high-end hardware of the order of more than 40000 dollars per Terabyte</td> 
	<td>Leverages commodity hardware which may cost less than 5000 dollars per TB</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>	Uses storage technologies like SAN (Storage Area Network) to store data</td> 
	<td>		Uses distributed data with data redundancy </td>
